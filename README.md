# ECDC HIV Estimates Accuracy tool

The [ECDC](https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/home) HIV Estimates Accuracy Tool is an application that uses
advanced statistical methods to correct for missing values in key HIV surveillance variables as well
as for reporting delay.

The tool accepts case based HIV surveillance data prepared in a specific format.

The outputs include results from pre-defined analyses in the form of a report containing tables and
graphs, and datasets, in which the adjustments have been incorporated and which may be exported for
further analysis.
